There is nothing like a good quote?

But separating the good quotes from the bad ones can be a [never-ending journey](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mightymaxims/)!

Ever a worthy pass time, the quotations in this collection are here 'mostly' for educational demonstrations. Some quotes are 'good', some quotes are 'bad', and other quotations are simply 'ugly' - in need of no little editorial assistance.

First Project: Can you find the duplicate sayings?

Submitted for your perusal then, here are a few large quotation collections to enjoy. Ad-hoc software creations are encouraged.

Happy quotation 'questing!
